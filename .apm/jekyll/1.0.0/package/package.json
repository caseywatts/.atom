For example if you had `{% include snippet.html %}` Atom would open `INCLUDES_DIR/snippet.html`\n\n### Create a new Post\n\nWhen triggered this function brings up a popup at the top of the screen for you to type in the title of your new post e.g. `Something Really Cool!` (on the date 2/4/2014). When you submit the form a new file of `POSTSDIR/2014-04-02-something-really-cool.POST_FORMAT` will be created with a very basic front matter and opened on the screen.\n\n### Open Config\n\nOpens `_config.yml`\n\n### Open Data File\n\nWhen Triggered this function looks at the text around your cursor to find the data file to open. For Example triggering Open Data File whilst your cursor is within the `site.data.team` in this `{{ blah site.data.team }}` would result in `DATADIR/team.yml` being opened.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n`Cmd-Alt-L` Open the layout for the current file\n\n`Cmd-Alt-D` Open the Datafile\n\n`Cmd-Shift-I` Open include\n\n`Cmd-Alt-J` Create a new post\n\n`Cmd-Alt-T` Open the toolbar\n\n`Alt-Shift-T` Turn the server on/off\n\n## Snippets\n\nThere are a load of snippets provided by this plugin, please check the settings pane in atom for a full list.\n\n# Contributing\n\nFeel free to fork this repo and submit changes!\n\nWhen you fork Jekyll-Atom please:\n\n1.
